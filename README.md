# Floton, a Custom C++ Ray-Tracer

### Introduction

Floton is a simple, lightweight CPU ray tracer written in c++. Its current purpose is mainly for use as an educational tool for those looking to learn more about how a ray tracer works, though more fully flushed out features may come in the future.

### How it works
Floton uses a technique called ray tracing to render realistic graphical images. Taken from Wikipedia,"ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost. This makes ray tracing best suited for applications where the image can be rendered slowly ahead of time, such as in still images and film and television visual effects, and more poorly suited for real-time applications like video games where speed is critical."
